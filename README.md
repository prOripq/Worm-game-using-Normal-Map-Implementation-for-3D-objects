# 🐍 Worm Game — Normal Map Implementation for 3D Objects

## 🎮 Overview
This project is a **3D Worm Game** prototype demonstrating **Normal Mapping** in OpenGL.  
It uses **GLFW**, **GLM**, and **stb_image** to render a textured worm model with both diffuse and normal maps.

## 🧱 Features
- 3D rendering using modern OpenGL (Core Profile)
- Diffuse and normal texture mapping
- Simple worm body model
- Camera movement and basic lighting
- Modular shader and texture loading
