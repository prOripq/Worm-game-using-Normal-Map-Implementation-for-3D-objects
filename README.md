# 🐍 Worm Game — Normal Map Implementation for 3D Objects

## 🎮 Overview
This project is a **3D Worm Game** prototype demonstrating **Normal Mapping** in OpenGL.  
It uses **GLFW**, **GLM**, and **stb_image** to render a textured worm model with both diffuse and normal maps.  

The goal is to visualize how normal maps enhance lighting realism on low-poly 3D surfaces.
